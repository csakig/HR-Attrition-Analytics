# 📊 HR Attrition Analytics & Decision Support

![Dashboard Preview](dashboard_preview.png)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on **predicting employee turnover** (attrition) and identifying key drivers of churn using data science techniques. It serves as a practical demonstration of **Data-Driven HR Decision Support**.

The analysis is based on the **IBM HR Analytics Dataset** and covers the full data pipeline from cleaning to predictive modeling and interactive visualization.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Tools
* **Python:** Data Cleaning, EDA, Feature Engineering
* **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression vs. Random Forest)
* **Explainable AI (XAI):** SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretation
* **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Business Intelligence:** Microsoft Power BI (Interactive Dashboard)

## 📂 Repository Contents
* `Employee_Attrition_Prediction_with_ML_and_SHAP.ipynb`: The complete Python source code with detailed explanations.
* `HR_Attrition_Analytics_Dashboard.pbix`: The interactive Power BI dashboard file.
* `ibm_attrition_for_powerbi.csv`: The processed dataset used for the dashboard.

## 🔍 Key Findings
1.  **Income & Tenure:** Low monthly income and the first 1-2 years at the company are the highest risk factors.
2.  **Overtime:** Employees working overtime are **3x more likely** to leave.
3.  **Role Specifics:** Sales Representatives have a critical attrition rate (~40%).

## 🚀 How to Use
1.  View the **Python Notebook** directly here on GitHub to see the code logic.
2.  Download the **.pbix file** to explore the interactive dashboard (requires Power BI Desktop).
